Component files should be made separate 

Example Hello Component should be written in Hello.js button component should be written in button.js.

They should be finally rendered into App component which is conventionally written in index.js and all the scripts are included in index.html and hello.js script should be placed before index.js.


class App extends React.Component{
render(){

return (

<Hello />
<Button />

);

}

}

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
